# Orion PTT System Terraform

[![Current Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/orion-labs/orion-ptt-system-terraform.svg)](https://img.shields.io/github/release/orion-labs/orion-ptt-system-terraform.svg)

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/orion-labs/orion-ptt-system-terraform.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/orion-labs/orion-ptt-system-terraform)

Terraform module for configuring the Orion PTT System on AWS.

Leverage [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to create a Kubernetes Cluster on Amazon EC2 together with Security Groups and Load Balancers sufficient to enable access from the internet to the Orion PTT System.

# Prerequisites

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) version 0.12 or higher

* AWS API Credentials with enough power to create resources in your VPC.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository [https://github.com/orion-labs/orion-ptt-system-terraform](https://github.com/orion-labs/orion-ptt-system-terraform)

1. From the root of the repository clone, initialize terraform by running: `terraform init`.

1. From the root of the repository clone, apply the config by running: `terraform apply`.  You will be asked for the following parameters:

    * **key_name** The name of an SSH Keypair registered with AWS

    * **prefix**  A unique prefix that gets prepended to all resources

    * **subnet_id** ID of the subnet in which EC2 instances will be created

    * **vpc_id** ID of your VPC

   Alternately, you can put these values in a file of the following form:

         key_name   = "Your Key Name"
         prefix     = "some-prefix"
         subnet_id  = "subnet-00ba34afc"
         vpc_id     = "vpc-44a237f"

   Then you can run: `tf apply -var-file=<filename>`.

   The output will look something like:

       data.aws_ami.ubuntu: Refreshing state...
       data.aws_vpc.default: Refreshing state...
       data.aws_subnet_ids.default: Refreshing state...

        An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
        Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
        + create

        Terraform will perform the following actions:

            Do you want to perform these actions?
            Terraform will perform the actions described above.
            Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

   Enter `yes` to proceed with creation of the stack.

*NB: This terraform code will install the necessary infrastructure to run the Orion PTT System.  The system itself will not operate without a valid license from [Orion Labs](https://orionlabs.io). *

## DNS

The Terraform module at [https://github.com/orion-labs/orion-ptt-system-terraform](https://github.com/orion-labs/orion-ptt-system-terraform) can optionally configure DNS records via Route53.  DNS management is disabled by default.

To enable DNS via Route53, add the following optional variables in your variable file:

         dns_zone_id = "<Your Route53 DNS Zone ID"
         domain      = "<your domain name>"
         create_dns  = true

If you choose not to follow this step, you will need to set up DNS manually, or use the above repo as a module in your own terraform code that configures DNS independently.

To configure DNS Records manually, consult your DNS Provider, or see [https://aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) for reference.
